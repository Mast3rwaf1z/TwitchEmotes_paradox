## From Source
For the more technical people of the guild, you can also just clone the repo in Interface/AddOns/TwitchEmotes_paradox, that way you can also contribute easier
* I have not provided a .toc file, please use the generateToc.sh file or grab the file from a built artifact on curseforge depending on your platform.

# Contributing
Adding new emotes is as simple as adding a new .tga file under Emotes and adding the file with the expected width and height to the paradox_emotes table in `Main.lua`
